# PythonCS50FinalProjet
A final project for CS50P 

#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/fd4aszSH5Q4>

## The mp4 and mp3 downloader for youtube
The idea is that I will use the essential library to create a .py file that will **download your favorite youtube video or mp3 music that you love with best quality!**

## Library that I used:
- pytube
- pydub
- ffmpeg
- pytest
- os
- sys
- PIL (pillow)

## How to use this program:

Firstly, I want to say that the core code which is the project.py file has complete functions to download but  kinda lazy about designing a GUI for friendly interface. In the future, I will try to made an update for the GUI :>

### Open your terminal
<p> From your terminal type </p><br>
`$ python project.py `

<p> Then will show the title and then ask you some questions about the url that you just type</p><br>

### Example
`$ python project.py
Enter a Youtube video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw
Me at the zoo
Do you want to download a mp4 video (Yes/No)? Yes
Do you want to download a mp3 audio (Yes/No)? Yes
Thank you or downloading!`

<p> And That's it! Enjoy your downloaded video and audio! <p>
